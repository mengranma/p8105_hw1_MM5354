Problem 1
=========

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from a *uniform distribution*:

``` r
sample = runif(10, min=0, max=5)
```

I can take the mean of the sample, too! The mean is 3.305916.

Next, creating the following required vectors: A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2 A (length-10) character vector A (length-10) factor vector

``` r
vec_logical = sample > 2
vec_char = character(length = 10 )
vec_factor = factor(10)
```

``` r
convert_veclog = as.numeric(vec_logical)
convert_vecchar = as.numeric(vec_char)
convert_vecfact = as.numeric(vec_factor)
```
