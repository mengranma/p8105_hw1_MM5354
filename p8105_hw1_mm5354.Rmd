```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
#Problem 1

```{r include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```


Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _uniform distribution_:

```{r uniform_sample}
sample = runif(10, min=0, max=5)
```
I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(sample)`.

Next, creating the following required vectors:
A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2
A (length-10) character vector
A (length-10) factor vector

```{r vectors}
vec_logical = sample > 2
vec_char = character(length = 10 )
vec_factor = factor(10)
```


```{r convert}
convert_veclog = as.numeric(vec_logical)
convert_vecchar = as.numeric(vec_char)
convert_vecfact = as.numeric(vec_factor)
```
